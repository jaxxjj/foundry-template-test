# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 40](../src/Counter.sol#L40)

	```solidity
	    ) internal override onlyOwner { }
	```

</details>



## L-2: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

## L-3: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-6: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

</details>



## L-7: State variable could be declared constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.
