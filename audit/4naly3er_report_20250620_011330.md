### <a name="GAS-3"></a>[GAS-3] Use shift right/left instead of division/multiplication if possible
While the `DIV` / `MUL` opcode uses 5 gas, the `SHR` / `SHL` opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, beware that Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting. Eventually, overflow checks are never performed for shift operations as they are done for arithmetic operations. Instead, the result is always truncated, so the calculation can be unchecked in Solidity version `0.8+`
- Use `>> 1` instead of `/ 2`
- Use `>> 2` instead of `/ 4`
- Use `<< 3` instead of `* 8`
- ...
- Use `>> 5` instead of `/ 2^5 == / 32`
- Use `<< 6` instead of `* 2^6 == * 64`

TL;DR:
- Shifting left by N is like multiplying by 2^N (Each bits to the left is an increased power of 2)
- Shifting right by N is like dividing by 2^N (Each bits to the right is a decreased power of 2)

*Saves around 2 gas + 20 for unchecked per instance*

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

147:             requiredCollateral = requiredCollateral / 2;

```

### <a name="GAS-4"></a>[GAS-4] Use of `this` instead of marking as `public` an `external` function
Using `this.` is like making an expensive external call. Consider marking the called function as public

*Saves around 2000 gas per instance*

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

209:         uint256 borrowWithInterest = this.getCurrentBorrowBalance(user);

```

### <a name="GAS-5"></a>[GAS-5] Use != 0 instead of > 0 for unsigned integer comparison

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: CounterV2.sol

11:         if (currentValue > 0) {

```

### <a name="NC-1"></a>[NC-1] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers
Even [assembly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/9d7ce4d08bf3c3010304a0476a785c70c0e90ae7/contracts/lib/TokenTransferrer.sol#L35-L39) can benefit from using readable constants instead of hex/numeric literals

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

25:     uint256 public interestRatePerSecond = 100000000000;

86:         if (amount % 1000 == 123) {

```

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Consider disabling `renounceOwnership()`
If the plan for your project does not include eventually giving up all ownership control, consider overwriting OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`'s `renounceOwnership()` function in order to disable it.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

10: contract Counter is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {

```

### <a name="NC-4"></a>[NC-4] Functions should not be longer than 50 lines
Overly complex code can make understanding functionality more difficult, try to further modularize your code to ensure readability 

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

30:     function getCount() public view returns (uint256) {

34:     function version() public pure virtual returns (string memory) {

```

```solidity
File: CounterV2.sol

16:     function version() public pure override returns (string memory) {

```

### <a name="NC-5"></a>[NC-5] Use a `modifier` instead of a `require/if` statement for a special `msg.sender` actor
If a function is supposed to be access-controlled, a `modifier` should be used instead of a `require/if` statement for more readability.

*Instances (7)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

82:         if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientBalance();

118:         if (collateral[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientCollateral();

121:         uint256 requiredCollateral = (borrows[msg.sender] * collateralRatio) / 1e18;

122:         if (collateral[msg.sender] - amount < requiredCollateral) {

146:         if (collateral[msg.sender] > 10000 && borrows[msg.sender] == 0) {

150:         if (collateral[msg.sender] < requiredCollateral + (borrows[msg.sender] * collateralRatio) / 1e18) {

173:         if (borrows[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__RepayAmountExceedsDebt();

```

### <a name="NC-6"></a>[NC-6] Take advantage of Custom Error's return value property
An important feature of Custom Error is that values such as address, tokenID, msg.value can be written inside the () sign, this kind of approach provides a serious advantage in debugging and examining the revert details of dapps such as tenderly.

*Instances (12)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

54:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

77:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

82:         if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientBalance();

103:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

117:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

118:         if (collateral[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientCollateral();

123:             revert VulnerableLendingPool__WouldBeUndercollateralized();

138:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

139:         if (totalDeposits - totalBorrows < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__NotEnoughLiquidity();

151:             revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientCollateral();

168:         if (amount == 0) revert VulnerableLendingPool__ZeroAmount();

173:         if (borrows[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__RepayAmountExceedsDebt();

```

### <a name="NC-7"></a>[NC-7] Use scientific notation for readability reasons for large multiples of ten
The more a number has zeros, the harder it becomes to see with the eyes if it's the intended value. To ease auditing and bug bounty hunting, consider using the scientific notation

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

25:     uint256 public interestRatePerSecond = 100000000000;

```

### <a name="NC-8"></a>[NC-8] Use Underscores for Number Literals (add an underscore every 3 digits)

*Instances (3)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

25:     uint256 public interestRatePerSecond = 100000000000;

86:         if (amount % 1000 == 123) {

146:         if (collateral[msg.sender] > 10000 && borrows[msg.sender] == 0) {

```

| [L-6](#L-6) | Upgradeable contract not initialized | 8 |
### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Use a 2-step ownership transfer pattern
Recommend considering implementing a two step process where the owner or admin nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account. Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two step procedure on the critical functions.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

10: contract Counter is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Division by zero not prevented
The divisions below take an input parameter which does not have any zero-value checks, which may lead to the functions reverting when zero is passed.

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

194:         uint256 interest = (borrows[user] * interestRatePerSecond) / (timeElapsed * 1e18);

213:             return (collateral[user] * 1e18) / requiredCollateral;

215:             return (collateral[user] * 1e18) / requiredCollateral;

232:         uint256 interest = (borrows[user] * interestRatePerSecond) / (timeElapsed * 1e18);

```

### <a name="L-3"></a>[L-3] Initializers could be front-run
Initializers could be front-run, allowing an attacker to either set their own values, take ownership of the contract, and in the best case forcing a re-deployment

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

18:     function initialize(

20:     ) public initializer {

21:         __Ownable_init(initialOwner);

22:         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

```

### <a name="L-4"></a>[L-4] Use `Ownable2Step.transferOwnership` instead of `Ownable.transferOwnership`
Use [Ownable2Step.transferOwnership](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) which is safer. Use it as it is more secure due to 2-stage ownership transfer.

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Use <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol">Ownable2Step.sol</a>
  
  ```solidity
      function acceptOwnership() external {
          address sender = _msgSender();
          require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
          _transferOwnership(sender);
      }
```

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

5: import "@openzeppelin-upgrades/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

```

### <a name="L-5"></a>[L-5] Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions
See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

5: import "@openzeppelin-upgrades/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

6: import "@openzeppelin-upgrades/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";

10: contract Counter is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {

22:         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

```

### <a name="L-6"></a>[L-6] Upgradeable contract not initialized
Upgradeable contracts are initialized via an initializer function rather than by a constructor. Leaving such a contract uninitialized may lead to it being taken over by a malicious user

*Instances (8)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

5: import "@openzeppelin-upgrades/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol";

6: import "@openzeppelin-upgrades/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";

10: contract Counter is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {

15:         _disableInitializers();

18:     function initialize(

20:     ) public initializer {

21:         __Ownable_init(initialOwner);

22:         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

```
