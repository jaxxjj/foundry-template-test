### <a name="GAS-3"></a>[GAS-3] Use shift right/left instead of division/multiplication if possible
While the `DIV` / `MUL` opcode uses 5 gas, the `SHR` / `SHL` opcode only uses 3 gas. Furthermore, beware that Solidity's division operation also includes a division-by-0 prevention which is bypassed using shifting. Eventually, overflow checks are never performed for shift operations as they are done for arithmetic operations. Instead, the result is always truncated, so the calculation can be unchecked in Solidity version `0.8+`
- Use `>> 1` instead of `/ 2`
- Use `>> 2` instead of `/ 4`
- Use `<< 3` instead of `* 8`
- ...
- Use `>> 5` instead of `/ 2^5 == / 32`
- Use `<< 6` instead of `* 2^6 == * 64`

TL;DR:
- Shifting left by N is like multiplying by 2^N (Each bits to the left is an increased power of 2)
- Shifting right by N is like dividing by 2^N (Each bits to the right is a decreased power of 2)

*Saves around 2 gas + 20 for unchecked per instance*

```

### <a name="GAS-4"></a>[GAS-4] Use of `this` instead of marking as `public` an `external` function
Using `this.` is like making an expensive external call. Consider marking the called function as public

*Saves around 2000 gas per instance*

### <a name="NC-3"></a>[NC-3] Consider disabling `renounceOwnership()`
If the plan for your project does not include eventually giving up all ownership control, consider overwriting OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`'s `renounceOwnership()` function in order to disable it.

### <a name="NC-5"></a>[NC-5] Missing Event for critical parameters change
Events help non-contract tools to track changes, and events prevent users from being surprised by changes.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity

```

### <a name="NC-6"></a>[NC-6] Use a `modifier` instead of a `require/if` statement for a special `msg.sender` actor
If a function is supposed to be access-controlled, a `modifier` should be used instead of a `require/if` statement for more readability.

*Instances (7)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

82:         if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientBalance();

118:         if (collateral[msg.sender] < amount) revert VulnerableLendingPool__InsufficientCollateral();

### <a name="NC-7"></a>[NC-7] Take advantage of Custom Error's return value property
An important feature of Custom Error is that values such as address, tokenID, msg.value can be written inside the () sign, this kind of approach provides a serious advantage in debugging and examining the revert details of dapps such as tenderly.

### <a name="NC-9"></a>[NC-9] Contract does not follow the Solidity style guide's suggested layout ordering
The [style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#order-of-layout) says that, within a contract, the ordering should be:

1) Type declarations
2) State variables
3) Events
4) Modifiers
5) Functions

However, the contract(s) below do not follow this ordering

```

### <a name="NC-11"></a>[NC-11] Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

*Instances (6)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

32:     event Deposit(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

33:     event Withdraw(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

| [L-8](#L-8) | Upgradeable contract not initialized | 8 |
### <a name="L-1"></a>[L-1] Use a 2-step ownership transfer pattern
Recommend considering implementing a two step process where the owner or admin nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()` function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed. This ensures the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account. Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two step procedure on the critical functions.

*Instances (1)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

10: contract Counter is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {

```

### <a name="L-2"></a>[L-2] Division by zero not prevented
The divisions below take an input parameter which does not have any zero-value checks, which may lead to the functions reverting when zero is passed.

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: VulnerableLendingPool.sol

194:         uint256 interest = (borrows[user] * interestRatePerSecond) / (timeElapsed * 1e18);

213:             return (collateral[user] * 1e18) / requiredCollateral;

215:             return (collateral[user] * 1e18) / requiredCollateral;

232:         uint256 interest = (borrows[user] * interestRatePerSecond) / (timeElapsed * 1e18);

```

### <a name="L-3"></a>[L-3] Initializers could be front-run
Initializers could be front-run, allowing an attacker to either set their own values, take ownership of the contract, and in the best case forcing a re-deployment

*Instances (4)*:
```solidity
File: Counter.sol

18:     function initialize(

20:     ) public initializer {

21:         __Ownable_init(initialOwner);

22:         __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

```

### <a name="L-4"></a>[L-4] Solidity version 0.8.20+ may not work on other chains due to `PUSH0`
The compiler for Solidity 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to [Shanghai](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/05/10/solidity-0.8.20-release-announcement/#important-note), which includes the new `PUSH0` op code. This op code may not yet be implemented on all L2s, so deployment on these chains will fail. To work around this issue, use an earlier [EVM](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html?ref=zaryabs.com#setting-the-evm-version-to-target) [version](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler#evm_version). While the project itself may or may not compile with 0.8.20, other projects with which it integrates, or which extend this project may, and those projects will have problems deploying these contracts/libraries.

### <a name="L-5"></a>[L-5] Use `Ownable2Step.transferOwnership` instead of `Ownable.transferOwnership`
Use [Ownable2Step.transferOwnership](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) which is safer. Use it as it is more secure due to 2-stage ownership transfer.

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Use <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol">Ownable2Step.sol</a>
  
  ```solidity
      function acceptOwnership() external {
          address sender = _msgSender();
          require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
          _transferOwnership(sender);
      }

### <a name="L-6"></a>[L-6] File allows a version of solidity that is susceptible to an assembly optimizer bug
In solidity versions 0.8.13 and 0.8.14, there is an [optimizer bug](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/blob/499ab8abc19391be7b7b34f88953a067029a5b45/_posts/2022-06-15-inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug.md) where, if the use of a variable is in a separate `assembly` block from the block in which it was stored, the `mstore` operation is optimized out, leading to uninitialized memory. The code currently does not have such a pattern of execution, but it does use `mstore`s in `assembly` blocks, so it is a risk for future changes. The affected solidity versions should be avoided if at all possible.

### <a name="L-7"></a>[L-7] Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions
See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.
